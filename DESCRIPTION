Description: This package provides tools for computing and analyzing
        dependency relationships among R packages.  It provides tools
        for building a graph-based representation of the dependencies
        among all packages in a list of CRAN-style package
        repositories.  There are also utilities for computing
        installation order of a given package.  If the RCurl package is
        available, an estimate of the download size required to install
        a given package and its dependencies can be obtained.
