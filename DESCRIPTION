Description: This package provides tools for computing and analyzing 
             dependency relationships among R packages.  It provides
             tools for building a graph-based representation of the
             dependencies among all packages in a list of CRAN-style
             package repositories.  There are also utilities for 
             computing installation order of a given package.  If
             the RCurl package is available, an estimate of the 
             download size required to install a given package and
             its dependencies can be obtained.
